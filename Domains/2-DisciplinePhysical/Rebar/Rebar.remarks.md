# Rebar

This schema contains classes that are used to model the reinforcing bars used in concrete and masonry construction

Due to the importance of IFC in coordinating physical infrastructure, the classes in the schema are intended to have a 1:1 instance mapping (not *class* mapping!) with IFC that will work for transformations in either direction.  It is expected that round-trip transformations may result in changes that provide an *equivalent*, but not *identical* model.
