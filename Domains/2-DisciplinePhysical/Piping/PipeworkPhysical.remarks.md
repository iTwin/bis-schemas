# PipeworkPhysical

This schema contains classes that are commonly used in various types of piping networks, designed for the distribution of matter (e.g. gases, liquids, fluidized solids or slurries).

The following class-diagrams depict the main classes and relationships in the PipeworkPhysical schema:

![System classes](./media/PipeworkPhysical-system_classes.png)
![Flow-Element classes](./media/PipeworkPhysical-flow_classes.png)
![TypeDef classes](./media/PipeworkPhysical-typedef_classes.png)
![Port classes](./media/PipeworkPhysical-port_classes.png)

The following instance-diagram depict a few examples of classes from the PipeworkPhysical schema:

![Fittings](./media/PipeworkPhysical-fitting_instances.png)
![Valves](./media/PipeworkPhysical-valve_instances.png)
![Ports](./media/PipeworkPhysical-instances.png)

Rules and Patterns defined by the _ClassificationSystems_ schema are expected to be used in order to describe the classification of the PhysicalElement and PhysicalType sub-classes in this schema, in terms of International Classification Systems. The following instance-diagram depicts the classification of a `PipeType` instance by _Nominal Pipe Size_ and _Pipe Schedule_, two classification concepts standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).

The `PipingPortType` class captures two important concepts for a set of ports: 
1) Their outer and inner diameters.

The outer and inner diameters of a `PipingPortType` are captured via its `OuterDiameter` and `InnerDiameter` properties, whereas its end-condition is captured by specific subclasses of the `PipingPortType` class.

`PipingPortType`s can be associated with PhysicalTypes implementing the `IPipingPhysicalType` mix-in, via the `PipingPhysicalTypeUsesPortTypes` relationship. That way, catalogs of PhysicalTypes can include data about their PipingPortTypes: diameters and end-condition of their ports.
