# BisCore

BisCore contains the core classes that define the [fundamental building-blocks of BIS](../guide/intro/fabric-of-the-universe/) (e.g. Models, Elements, and ElementAspects) and which specialize them to establish domain-neutral base-classes for modeling the real world from multiple Modeling Perspectives.

BisCore also contains some less-fundamental classes related to infrastructure engineering visualization and documentation in general, such as drawings, views, etc.

The core classes are decorated by ECCustomAttributes that effectively define the database schema mapping for an iModel, but which can be ignored for other kinds of BIS Repositories.  Other schemas cannot alter the underlying database schema mapping without explicit permission from BisCore.

The classes of BisCore are used as base classes for all classes in other BIS Domain schemas.

See [Base Infrastructure Schemas](../)

## Entity Classes

### ClassHasHandler

Applied to an ECClass to indicate that a system handler (written in C++) will supply behavior for it at run-time.
This custom attribute may only be used by BisCore and other core schemas.
Other schemas should use domain handlers (written in TypeScript) and the `SchemaHasBehavior` custom attribute applied to the ECSchema instead.

### ISubModeledElement

Sub-modeling is also sometimes described as "breaking down", i.e. a sub-modeled Element can be "broken down into" a finer-grained (sub) Model.  
See also [IParentElement](#iparentelement).

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `Element` only permits a sub-model to be inserted if the class of the *modeled element* implements the `ISubModeledElement` interface.

### IParentElement

Only subclasses of bis:Element can implement the IParentElement interface

Parent-child modeling differs from sub-modeling in that the parent Element and child Elements are to be considered together in the context of a single Model, whereas a sub-modeled Element is considered independently of its sub-Model. For example, and application would view a parent Element and its child Elements together, but would *either* view a sub-modeled Element *or* exclude that Element and instead view the Elements of its sub-Model.

See also [ISubModeledElement](#isubmodeledelement).

### InformationPartitionElement

An InformationPartitionElement partitions the information in a BIS Repository into non-overlapping hierarchies of Models and Elements, each with a distinct Modeling Perspective. In some cases it further-partitions information into distinct subsets within a Modeling Perspective, based on a specific domain.

A bis:Subject mentions a real-world Object. BIS *sees* the Object as one-or-more Entities, where each Entity considers the Object from a particular Modeling Perspective. A specialization of a bis:InformationPartitionElement establishes a Perspective for modeling the Object to which the Subject refers. The top-Model sub-models the Partition. The actual modeling of the Entity with one-or-more Elements of the appropriate Modeling Perspective begins in the top-Model.

See [Top of the World](../guide/data-organization/top-of-the-world/)

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `InformationPartitionElement` will only permit instances to be inserted into the `RepositoryModel`.
The system handler will also require every `InformationPartitionElement` to have its `Parent` property reference a `Subject`.

### DefinitionPartition

The 'Definition' Modeling Perspective is for modeling definitions of things that are shared by multiple particular Entities.

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `DefinitionPartition` ensures that it is only ever sub-modeled by a `DefinitionModel`.

### DocumentPartition

The 'Document' Modeling Perspective is a subset of the 'Information' Modeling Perspective. It holds Elements which describes Entities using Documents and is used to create primary documents such as Drawings.

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `DocumentPartition` ensures that it is only ever sub-modeled by an `InformationModel` (typically `DocumentListModel`).

### GroupInformationPartition

The 'GroupInformation' Modeling Perspective is a subset of the 'Information' Modeling Perspective. It is used primarily to hold `generic:Group` Elements generated from DgnV8 'Named Groups'.

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `GroupInformationPartition` ensures that it is only ever sub-modeled by a `GroupInformationModel`.

### InformationRecordPartition

The 'InformationRecord' Modeling Perspective is a subset of the 'Information' Modeling Perspective. It can hold a broad array of information records describing Entities.

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `InformationRecordPartition` ensures that it is only ever sub-modeled by a `InformationRecordModel`.

### LinkPartition

The 'Link' Modeling Perspective is a subset of the 'Information' Modeling Perspective. It is used to hold links to external repositories, e.g. in the form of `bis:RepositoryLink` elements.

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `LinkPartition` ensures that it is only ever sub-modeled by a `LinkModel`.

### LinkElement

The link is generally to some resource, e.g. the subclass `UrlLink` points to an external resource while `EmbeddedFileLink` points to files embedded in an iModel.

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `LinkElement` ensures that it is only ever inserted into an `InformationModel`.

### PhysicalPartition

The 'Physical' Perspective is for modeling physical Entities (which have mass) and for spatial location Entities (which are generally either defined-by physical Entities or are used-to-define physical Entities).

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `PhysicalPartition` ensures that it is only ever sub-modeled by a `SpatialModel`.

### PhysicalSystemPartition

The 'Physical System' Modeling Perspective is a subset of the 'Information' Modeling Perspective. It holds Elements which group a collection of connected Entities (primarily Physical) that collectively implement some function..

### PhysicalSystemAggregatesSubSystems

Forms a strict hierarchy (A PhysicalSystem can only be aggregated by a single 'aggregator').

See [PhysicalSystem](#physicalsystem) for more information.

### SpatialLocationPartition

The “Spatial Location” perspective is a strict subset of the “Physical” perspective. Spatial locations are massless, but they manifest in the real physical world:

- They may be defined in relation to physical entities, e.g. the air gap between two conductors, the space around an access panel, the volume occupied by a physical Entity, or a surface demarcating a region on the surface of a physical entity.
- They may be used to guide positioning of physical Entities, e.g. grid lines that may be manifested physically on a construction site via chalk lines or laser beams.
- They may be abstractions of physical consequence, like property or political boundaries that are often demarcated in the physical world via markers, signs, or natural boundaries.

The 'Spatial Location' perspective is used by SpatialLocationModel and SpatialLocationElement in order to segregate certain kinds of elements.

In retrospect, the complexity added by introducing a distinct "Spatial Location" perspective may have not been worth the benefit. Our current recommendation is to not instantiate a SpatialLocationPartition, but instead organize spatial locations in the context of the 'physical backbone', i.e. the Physical model hierarchy.

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `SpatialLocationPartition` ensures that it is only ever sub-modeled by a `SpatialLocationModel`.

### Model

See [Model Fundamentals](../guide/fundamentals/model-fundamentals/).

> Behavior: System handlers (written in C++) and domain handlers (written in TypeScript) provide behavior to specific `Model` subclasses.
The system handler for `Model` requires its `ModeledElement` property to reference an `Element` that implements `ISubModeledElement`.
This is enforced for all `Model` subclasses.

### ModelOwnsSubModel

See [Model.ParentModel](#model) ECNavigationProperty.

### ModelContainsElements

See [Element.Model](#element) ECNavigationProperty.

### ModelModelsElement

See [Model.ModeledElement](#model) ECNavigationProperty.

A more accurate name for this relationship would have been 'ModelSubModelsElement', but the existing name cannot be changed in this generation of BIS.

### DrawingModelBreaksDownDrawing

A more consistent name for this relationship would have been 'DrawingModelSubModelsDrawing', but the existing name cannot be changed in this generation of BIS. At times, we use "breaks down" as a synonym for "sub-models", but we are standardizing on "sub-models", reserving "breakdown" for use with various engineering breakdown structures.

### SheetModelBreaksDownSheet

A more consistent name for this relationship would have been 'SheetModelSubModelsSheet', but the existing name cannot be changed in this generation of BIS. At times, we use "breaks down" as a synonym for "sub-models", but we are standardizing on "sub-models", reserving "breakdown" for use with various engineering breakdown structures.

### Element

See [Element Fundamentals](../guide/fundamentals/element-fundamentals/).

> Behavior: System handlers (written in C++) and domain handlers (written in TypeScript) provide behavior to specific `Element` subclasses.
The system handler for `Element` requires a valid `Model` reference and a valid or *empty* `Code`.
If the `Parent` property is not `NULL`, the system handler also requires that the child Element be in the same Model as the parent Element.
This is enforced for all `Element` subclasses.

### ElementDrivesElement

In iModels, a change-propagation system calls handlers that allow the driven Element to be affected by the driving Element.
See [DriverBundleElement](#driverbundleelement).

### DriverBundleElement

Used when multiple inputs for a "driving" relationship cannot be considered in isolation.

See [ElementDrivesElement](#elementdriveselement).

### TypeDefinitionElement

A `TypeDefinitionElement` is an implementation of a data normalization strategy and is meant to hold properties that vary per *type* instead of varying per `Element` instance.
Rather than storing the same set of *type-specific* properties on every `Element` instance, each `Element` instance will have a set of *instance-specific* properties (as specified by the `Element` class) and a set of related *type-specific* properties found by joining to the `TypeDefinitionElement` instance.

See relationships such as [PhysicalElementIsOfType](#physicalelementisoftype).

### PhysicalElementIsOfType

### PhysicalType

A `PhysicalType` is particularly useful in cases where a physical item can be ordered from a *catalog*.
Each type of item will have the same set of *type-specific* properties.
For example: manufacturer name, model number, maintenance intervals, etc.

### Subject

`Subject` elements only exist in the [RepositoryModel](#repositorymodel) singleton at the root of a BIS Repository. There will be one "root" instance of `Subject` that does not have a parent `Subject`. Child `Subject` elements reference "parts" of the real-world Object referenced by their parent `Subject` element.

The hierarchy of `Subject`s is not meant to model the root Object's structure, but is a way to express high-level structure that has not been modeled explicitly. `Subjects` do not "model" or "represent" or "describe" the Object that they reference. All modeling happens using Elements in the other bis:Models in the BIS Repository.

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `Subject` will only permit instances to be inserted into the `RepositoryModel`.
It will require every `Subject` except for the "root" to have its `Parent` property reference another `Subject`.
The system handler also prevents the "root" `Subject` from ever being deleted.

### Category

Categories should be standardized by domain groups where possible. They generally correlate with groups of BIS Element classes, or a single base class.

See [Categories Introduction](../guide/fundamentals/categories/).

Also see the [ClassificationSystems](./classificationsystems.ecschema/) domain schema for another way of categorizing and classifying elements.

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `Category` requires a valid `CodeValue` (name) for every instance.
It will insert a *default* `SubCategory` for every `Category` that is inserted.
The system handler also restricts deletion. A `Category` can only be deleted via a more expensive `deleteDefinitionElements` method that has determined the `Category` is no longer referenced.

### SubCategory

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `SubCategory` requires a valid `CodeValue` (name) and a `Parent` property that references its owning `Category`.
The system handler also restricts deletion. A `SubCategory` can only be deleted via a more expensive `deleteDefinitionElements` method that has determined the `SubCategory` is no longer referenced.

### ColorBook

Individual colors are stored in JsonProperties

### GeometryPart

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `GeometryPart` requires valid geometry stored in the `GeometryStream` property for insertion to succeed.
The system handler also restricts deletion. A `GeometryPart` can only be deleted via a more expensive `deleteDefinitionElements` method that has determined the `GeometryPart` is no longer referenced.

### LineStyle

> Behavior: The system handler restricts deletion. A `LineStyle` can only be deleted via a more expensive `deleteDefinitionElements` method that has determined the `LineStyle` is no longer referenced.

### Texture

> Behavior: The system handler restricts deletion. A `Texture` can only be deleted via a more expensive `deleteDefinitionElements` method that has determined the `Texture` is no longer referenced.

### PhysicalMaterial

The `PhysicalMaterial` serves as the base class for the materials in the PhysicalMaterial schema.  Generally, it is expected that domain-specific properties (e.g. strength properties for the structural domain) will be added to the subclasses such as Concrete and Steel using domain-specific ElementAspects.

The Density property in this base `PhysicalMaterial` class is intended to provide basic weight computation for the purposes of quantity takeoff and carbon footprint, for example, which are cross-domain functions.  This kindOfQuantity for this property is AECU:DENSITY.

### RenderMaterial

Marked as "Sealed" because JsonProperties will be used to persist data. This allows a single instance to "morph" between a DgnV8 render material and a future PBR material.

> Behavior: The system handler restricts deletion. A `RenderMaterial` can only be deleted via a more expensive `deleteDefinitionElements` method that has determined the `RenderMaterial` is no longer referenced.

### RenderTimeline

This information used to be stored within the `DisplayStyle` but was refactored out as a separate element for efficiency and reuse purposes.

### SectionLocationUsesCategorySelector

See [SectionLocation.CategorySelector ECNavigationProperty](#SectionLocation) ECNavigationProperty

### ViewDefinition

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `ViewDefinition` requires a valid `DisplayStyle` reference and a valid `CategorySelector` reference.
This applies to all `ViewDefinition` subclasses.
The system handler also restricts deletion. A `ViewDefinition` can only be deleted via a more expensive `deleteDefinitionElements` method that has determined the `ViewDefinition` is no longer referenced.

### SpatialViewDefinition

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `SpatialViewDefinition` requires a valid `ModelSelector` reference.
The restrictions of the superclass also apply.

### ModelSelector

> Behavior: The system handler restricts deletion. A `ModelSelector` can only be deleted via a more expensive `deleteDefinitionElements` method that has determined the `ModelSelector` is no longer referenced.

### CategorySelector

> Behavior: The system handler restricts deletion. A `CategorySelector` can only be deleted via a more expensive `deleteDefinitionElements` method that has determined the `CategorySelector` is no longer referenced.

### DisplayStyle

> Behavior: The system handler restricts deletion. A `DisplayStyle` can only be deleted via a more expensive `deleteDefinitionElements` method that has determined the `DisplayStyle` is no longer referenced.

### CustomHandledProperty

See [CustomHandledPropertyStatementType](#CustomHandledPropertyStatementType).

### ChannelRootAspect

An *iModel Bridge* uses the `ChannelRootAspect` to indicate ownership of a *channel*.
A *channel* is a portion of the iModel's hierarchy that begins at the specified Element and recursively descends down through `ElementOwnsChildElements` and `ModelModelsElement` relationships to include all of the child elements and sub-models.

### DefinitionSet

`DefinitionSet` represents a set of `DefinitionElement`s. The set may be exclusive (`DefinitionContainer` owns its `DefinitionElement`s) or may be non-exclusive (`DefinitionGroup` does not own its `DefinitionElement`s). `DefinitionSet` should *only* be *directly* subclassed by `DefinitionGroup` and `DefinitionContainer`. `DefinitionGroup` and `DefinitionContainer` may be further subclassed.

References to `DefinitionSet`s will generally treat the `DefinitionSet`s recursively. If *`DefinitionSet` A* contains *`DefinitionSet` B* and *`DefinitionSet` C*, the members of *`DefinitionSet` B* and *`DefinitionSet` C* will be considered to be first class members of *`DefinitionSet` A* (effectively they will be considered as peers of the `DefinitionElement`s that are directly contained in *`DefinitionSet` A*). This recursive interpretation extends through the full depth of nested `DefinitionSet`s.

### DefinitionGroup

`DefinitionGroup` is intended for defining non-exclusive sets of `DefinitionElement`s (a `DefinitionElement` may be in multiple `DefinitionGroup`s). `DefinitionGroup` holds its `DefinitionElement`s through the `DefinitionGroupGroupsDefinitions` relationship. The referenced `DefinitionElement`s may be contained in the same `DefinitionModel` as the `DefinitionGroup` or may be contained in other `DefinitionModel`s.

See `DefinitionSet` documentation for recursive interpretations of `DefinitionSet`s  containing `DefinitionSet`s.

Care must be taken to avoid circular references.  Note that even a single `DefinitionGroup` can create circular references in two cases:

- The `DefinitionGroup` directly contains itself.
- The `DefinitionGroup` contains a `DefinitionContainer` that directly or indirectly contains the `DefinitionGroup`.

### DefinitionContainer

`DefinitionContainer` represents a `DefinitionSet` that exclusively owns its `DefinitionElement`s. The exclusivity is only effective relative to other `DefinitionContainer`s (or similar `DefinitionElement`s that have sub-models); the `DefinitionElement`s that are contained in a `DefinitionContainer` may also be in one or more `DefinitionGroup`s.

See `DefinitionSet` documentation for recursive interpretations of `DefinitionSet`s containing `DefinitionSet`s.

A `DefinitionContainer` can conceptually be thought of as a *folder of definitions*.
A `DefinitionContainer` is recommended when there is a standard set of domain-specific definitions that must be known to domain software applications.
In this case, the `DefinitionContainer` should be contained by the `DictionaryModel` and found by the software via a known `Code`.

### DefinitionGroupGroupsDefinitions

A `DefinitionGroup` may not be both the source and the target of the same relationship instance.

### PhysicalSystem

A non-exclusive set of `SpatialElements` grouped using the `PhysicalSystemGroupsMembers` relationship. A `SpatialElement` can be a member of multiple `PhysicalSystems`.

The primary contents of the `PhysicalSystem` are `PhysicalElements`, but `SpatialLocationElements` can be included, as well.

The hierarchy of `PhysicalSystem`s is built using the [PhysicalSystemAggregatesSubSystems](#physicalsystemaggregatessubsystems) relationship, similar to [IfcRelAggregates](https://standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/DEV/IFC4_2/FINAL/HTML/schema/ifckernel/lexical/ifcrelaggregates.htm). The "source" Element of the relationship is an "Aggregator" that aggregates parts that are essentially a different representation of the aggregator, but at a finer granularity.

A Physical System can define as many levels of hierarchy as needed.

### SynchronizationConfigLink

A Link to the Configuration for a Synchronization Job.  By convention, a unique Id for the SynchronizationConfigLink such as a job Id should be set in the CodeValue property and a name should be set in in the UserLabel property.

### ExternalSourceGroup

If the `ExternalSourceGroup` has a *primary* repository than it should be persisted in the `Repository` property from its base class.
If the group does not have a *primary* repository than that property should be left as `NULL`.

### GeometricModel2d

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `GeometricModel2d` will prevent `GeometricElement3d` instances from being inserted to ensure that the model will only contain 2d geometry.
This restriction applies to all `GeometricModel2d` subclasses.
`InformationContentElement` instances (other than `DefinitionElement` subclasses) can also be inserted into a `GeometricModel2d`.

### GeometricElement2d

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `GeometricElement2d` will only permit instances to be inserted into a `GeometricModel2d` and will require its `Category` property to reference a `DrawingCategory`.
The system handler also requires a valid *placement* if `GeometryStream` is not `NULL`.

See [GeometryStream](../../learning/common/geometrystream/) for a more in-depth explanation about that property.

### DrawingModel

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `DrawingModel` ensures that the *modeled element* for a `DrawingModel` is a `Drawing` or a `TemplateRecipe2d`.
The restrictions from the `GeometricModel2d` superclass also apply.

### GeometricModel3d

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `GeometricModel3d` will prevent `GeometricElement2d` instances from being inserted to ensure that the model will only contain 3d geometry.
This restriction applies to all `GeometricModel3d` subclasses.
`InformationContentElement` instances (other than `DefinitionElement` subclasses) can also be inserted into a `GeometricModel3d`.

### GeometricElement3d

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `GeometricElement3d` will only permit instances to be inserted into a `GeometricModel3d` and will require its `Category` property to reference a `SpatialCategory`.
The system handler also requires a valid *placement* if `GeometryStream` is not `NULL`.

See [GeometryStream](../../learning/common/geometrystream/) for a more in-depth explanation about that property.

### SpatialLocationModel

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `SpatialLocationModel` will prevent `PhysicalElement` instances from being inserted since the primary intent is for the model to contain `SpatialLocationElement` instances.
`InformationContentElement` instances (other than `DefinitionElement` subclasses) can also be inserted into a `SpatialLocationModel`.
The restrictions from the `GeometricModel3d` superclass also apply.

### InformationModel

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `InformationModel` will only permit the insertion of `InformationContentElement` instances.
This restriction applies to all `InformationModel` subclasses.

### DefinitionModel

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `DefinitionElement` will only permit instances to be inserted into a `DefinitionModel`.
Other `InformationContentElement` instances can also be inserted into a `DefinitionModel`.

### DefinitionElement

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `DefinitionElement` will only permit instances to be inserted into a `DefinitionModel`.

### RepositoryModel

> Behavior: The singleton `RepositoryModel` behaves like a standard `InformationModel` and should have been a direct subclass of `InformationModel`. Unfortunately, it subclasses from `DefinitionModel` for legacy reasons that are no longer relevant. 
However, the system handler (C++) for `RepositoryModel` makes it act like a direct subclass of `InformationModel`.
Consistent with a standard `InformationModel`, all `InformationContentElement` instances except `DefinitionElement` subclasses may be inserted.
For backwards compatibility reasons, the superclass of `RepositoryModel` cannot be corrected until a major schema version upgrade.

### GroupInformationModel

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `GroupInformationModel` will only permit the insertion of `GroupInformationElement` instances.
The *modeled element* for an `GroupInformationModel` is expected to be an `GroupInformationPartition`.

### LinkModel

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `LinkModel` will only permit the insertion of `LinkElement` instances.
The *modeled element* for an `LinkModel` is expected to be a `LinkPartition`.

### InformationRecordModel

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `InformationRecordModel` will only permit the insertion of `InformationRecordElement` instances.
The *modeled element* for an `InformationRecordModel` is expected to be an `InformationRecordPartition`.

### DocumentListModel

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `DocumentListModel` will only permit the insertion of `Document` instances.
The *modeled element* for a `DocumentListModel` is expected to be a `DocumentPartition`.

### RoleModel

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `RoleModel` prevents `GeometricElement` instances from being inserted since the primary intent is for a `RoleModel` to contain `RoleElement` instances.
`InformationContentElement` instances (other than `DefinitionElement` subclasses) can also be inserted into a `RoleModel`.
This behavior applies to all `RoleModel` subclasses.
`FunctionalModel` (from the `Functional` schema) is the most widely known subclass of `RoleModel`.

### RoleElement

> Behavior: The system handler (C++) for `RoleElement` will only permit instances to be inserted into a `RoleModel`.
This behavior applies to all `RoleElement` subclasses.
`FunctionalElement` (from the `Functional` schema) is the most widely known subclass of `RoleElement`.
