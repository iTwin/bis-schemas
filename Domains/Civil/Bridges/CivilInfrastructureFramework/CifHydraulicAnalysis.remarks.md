iModelBridge schema used by the Civil iModel Bridge while publishing datasets containing Subsurface Utilities Design & Analysis information. The aspect classes contained within this schema, which focuses on the input properties of such module for a single scenario (typically the active one in the dataset), aim to provide a similar user-experience with respect to the source application properties, as well as make its data available for re-purposing.

This schema should not be considered the aligned BIS schema for any domain.
