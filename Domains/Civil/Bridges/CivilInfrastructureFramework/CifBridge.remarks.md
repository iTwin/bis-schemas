# CifBridge

iModelBridge schema used by the Civil iModel Bridge while publishing OpenBridge Modeler (OBM) datasets. The aspect classes contained within this schema aim to provide a similar user-experience with respect to OBM properties, as well as make its data available for re-purposing. 

This schema should not be considered the aligned BIS schema for the Bridge domain.
