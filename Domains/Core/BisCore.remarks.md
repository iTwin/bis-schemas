The BisCore schema also defines the database structure for an iModel.  Other schemas may not add to the db schema without explicit permission from BisCore.

## PhysicalPortion

Abstract base used to represent a part of a larger Element that can be broken down in more detail in a sub Model.  Division of the larger Element into portions is arbitrary, defined by convention in a domain or by a user and individual portions are not viable outside the larger Element.
