# ArchitecturalPhysical

This schema contains the concrete classes that are used to model the physical elements in a building in the architectural discipline.

The schema also contains `PhysicalTypes` of all classes. However it needs to be noted that not all subclasses of `bis:PhysicalElement` should have a [PhysicalType](../../Core/Biscore.remarks.md#PhysicalType). Please read the [PhysicalType documentation](../../Core/Biscore.remarks.md#PhysicalType) for more.
