# Grids

Contains classes modelling grids and grid systems.

This class diagram provides an overview for the key concepts for modelling grid systems and grids:

![Grids](./media/Grids.png)

Classes in the Grids schema are used to build `GridSystem`s and `Grid`s for structural, space-planning and other disciplines.

A `Grid` contains (in its submodel) a set of `GridCurves` (in a particular plane or surface) used to locate spatial elements.

A `GridSystem` is a collection of `Grid`s that are logically related.

`GridSystems` may also contain `GridSurface`s. To understand the optional `GridSurface` and `GridAxis` elements, an instance diagram is helpful:

![Grids-modelling](./media/grids_instance.png)

In plain language: Each curve in a grid represents a position along one of its axes. That position is defined by one surface in that axis intersected with the "plane" of the grid. Details follow...

Each `GridSurface` belongs to a `GridAxis`. Each `GridSurface` in an axis is usually parallel other surfaces in that axis, with the notable exception of the surfaces of a radial axis in a radial grid. Every `GridAxis` in a `GridSystem` is an axis of every `Grid` in the `GridSystem`.

If `GridSurfaces` *are* used, each `GridCurve` of each `Grid` should represent the intersection of one `GridSurface` of one of its axes with the "plane" of the `Grid`. The "plane" of the `Grid` is a `GridSurface` from a *different* `GridSystem` such as an "Elevation Grid System".(It is referred to as the "plane" of the `Grid` even though it may be a curved surface, e.g. a curved roof surface could be used as the "plane" of a grid for laying out the structural framing of the roof).

 A `GridSystem` like the "Elevation Grid System" may *only* contain a `GridAxis` and `GridSurfaces` used to define the "planes" of `Grid`s in a *different* `GridSystem` (e.g. one for use in a top-down view). Thus, if `GridSurface`s are used, the iModel will always contain at least two `GridSystem`s--one to define "planes" for `Grid`s in an orthogonal `GridSystem`. Each `GridSystem` may define "planes" for `Grid`s in the other.

Each `GridCurve` marks a position along a particular `GridAxis`, where the position is defined by a `GridSurface` of that `GridAxis`.

Each `GridSurface` owns a `GridLabelRecord` which holds information about the content and positioning of dynamically displayed labels for `GridCurve`s representing that `GridSurface`. The `Code.Value` of the `GridLabelRecord` should correspond to the `Code.Value` of the `GridCurve` that represents it. It will be used as the text of dynamically presented labels. See [Grid Labels](https://docs.bentley.com/LiveContent/web/OpenBuildings%20Designer%20Help-v5/en/GUID-5965684D-5CA4-BF92-3406-A43B5542ED30.html) in OpenBuildings Designer.

There is currently no relationship to indicate which `GridSurface` is serving as the "plane" of a given `Grid` and no relationship between a `GridCurve` and the `GridSurface` that it represents.  These relationships will appear in a future version of this schema designed to support automatic generation of `Grid`s from `GridSurface`s. The relationships have been omitted due to uncertainty in the details of the change-propagation mechanism that will be used. In the meantime, it should normally be obvious to users viewing iModels which `GridSurface`s correspond to which `Grid`s and `GridCurve`s.

A `GridSystem` should be stored in the model it's relevant in. For example, the structural grid for a building should be stored in the same model as the said `BuildingSpatial:Building`. The specific `Building` could be associated via `SpatialComposition:SpatialOrganizerHoldsSpatialElements` relationship.

## Classes

### GridCurve

`GridCurve` is similar to [IfcGridAxis](http://ifc43-docs.standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC4x3/HTML/lexical/IfcGridAxis.htm) and Grid Curves in `OpenBuildings Designer`.

`GridCurve`s are persisted in the submodel of a `Grid` element.

There are several specializations of `GridCurve`:

### GridSystem

The `Grids` of a `GridSystem` are logically and geometrically related, e.g. a set of parallel, storey-specific grids in a building that all share the same axes. A `GridSystem` may also contain surfaces (organized into axes) from which the grids can be derived.  See [Grids](#grids) for more detail and context.

A future version of the Grids schema will support software that can automatically derive `Grid`s from the axes and surfaces of a `GridSystem` (and a separate `GridSystem` to define the "planes" of the `Grid`s. )
