# BoundedUnitizedValue

This schema contains structs that can be used to define unitized properties with a bounded value, that is, which have a maximum of two numeric values assigned, the first value specifying the upper bound and the second value specifying the lower bound. A set point value can also be provided in addition to the upper and lower bound values in order to capture a typical value for the property.
